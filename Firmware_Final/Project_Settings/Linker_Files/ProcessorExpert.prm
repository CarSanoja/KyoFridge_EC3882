**        This file is used by the linker. It describes files to be linked,
**        memory ranges, stack size, etc. For detailed description of the PRM file
**        see CodeWarrior documentation. This file is generated by default.
**        You can switch off generation by setting the property
**        "Generate PRM file = no" on the compiler tab in CPU component and then modify
**        this file if needed.
